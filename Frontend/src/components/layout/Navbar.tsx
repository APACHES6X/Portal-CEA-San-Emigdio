// Keep this file as a tiny re-export so the project always resolves to the
// single implementation in Navbar.jsx. This is intentionally JS-only.
// Thin ES module bridge to the JSX implementation. Some build setups may
// resolve './Navbar' to Navbar.jsx. Export a named wrapper to avoid circular
// default-export alias problems.
//import NavbarImpl from './Navbar';
//export default NavbarImpl;
